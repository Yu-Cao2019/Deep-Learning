# What and why is Keras?

Different companies use different internal framework. 
For example, Facebook uses PyTorch, Google uses TensorFlow, Microsoft uses CNTK, and Amazon uses Mxnet.
In our course, we focus on PyTorch and TensorFlow.

By using Keras, computation graph would be more efficient. It is an open source, which means everyone can contribut to it.
