# What is deep learing? 
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning involving algorithms that have many nonlinear processing stages, refering to training neural networks that have many layers, which will be very complex. At the same time, larger networks require larger data sets to prevent overfitting.

When we need to process big data or complex problems, the computation of our machine is limited. At this time, cloud is needed to increase the computation power. 

The development of more powerful GPUs, and the associated general purpose programming languages, enabled larger neural networks to be tested.
