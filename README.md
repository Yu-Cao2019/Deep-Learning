# Deep-Learning
This is a course I am taking.  
It is based on neroun network. After we have a basic view of what is NN and how it works in machine learning course, we can move to a more complex one (neroun network with more layers). 
I will update what I've learn from class, what I've done in the class and some useful resouses. 
Welcome everyone to exchange and learn!
Thanks for my professor [Amir Jafari](https://github.com/amir-jafari), who is a great teacher! Many useful exercise also come from him.
